                        .: Brutalist Password Cracker :.
********************************************************************************

Experimenting with brute force password cracking.

No real practical application as of yet.

Current functionality includes setting minimum password length to limit guessing
to only passwords meeting minimum password requirements. Also includes three
modes; manual - user decides if the program should continue after every 100k
attempts and after each attack phase, semi-auto - user decides if program should
continue after each attack phase, and full-auto - program runs through all phases
without stopping until password is cracked or until ctrl-C.


********************************** GOALS ***************************************

Add smart dictionary attack.
Hash recognition.
Hash attempted passwords for use in cracking hashes.
